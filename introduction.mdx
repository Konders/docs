## What is the Partner API?

The Partner API gives enterprise exchange clients programmatic access to the exchange platform. Instead of using the staff panel manually, your systems can:

- Pull live exchange rates and office info
- Create and track client exchange orders
- Register and manage clients
- Receive real-time event notifications via webhooks

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Embed live rates in your website | `GET /partner/exchanges`, `GET /partner/offers` |
| Create orders from your Telegram bot | `POST /partner/orders` |
| Check order status in your CRM | `GET /partner/orders/:id` |
| Register clients without manual panel work | `POST /partner/clients` |
| React to order events in real time | Webhooks |

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API key">
    Log in to the staff panel, navigate to **Settings → API Keys**, and create a new key. Copy the raw key — it's shown only once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your first request">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.example.com/api/v1/partner/exchanges \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_personal_YOUR_KEY"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a webhook (optional)">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/partner/webhooks \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_personal_YOUR_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url":"https://your-app.com/hooks","events":["order.created"]}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Base URL

```
https://api.example.com/api/v1
```

All partner endpoints are prefixed with `/partner/`.
